<p>My father, uncle, and I stand atop the gravel road looking down at the farming village, on which my uncle has a share of the property. I wondered to myself, 'Do people really enjoy the farming lifestyle?' One of the rural areas of the Philippines in a community of Lloren, farming is the way of life for many locals. My father was explaining how he and his brother used to play down there as kids, and would swim in the river. Unlike those numerous occasions of shrugging off my father's stories of the Philippines, this time I was intrigued: I could see it for myself and experience his footsteps from decades ago. We started to walk down the gravel pathway, sweat trickling down my face from the afternoon sun that lacks a breeze. The breath-taking view--and being able to see the farming locals in their fields--make up for the sacrifice. Surrounding the tiny farming village down below are hills with trees spread throughout the land. A little stream cuts through the area where it is used by locals and animals. Little huts stand nearby with wire fencing protecting garden areas from animals. Water buffaloes roam freely nearby awaiting their next duty. </p><p>As we drew closer, locals look with curiosity at my father and I taking pictures. Fortunately, we are led by the head farmer my uncle knows, Tito. He is quite friendly and reassuringly comfortable showing us around. I was amazed at his positivity and spirit. For living such a simple life, Tito and his family look extremely healthy and content with their way of life. Tito explains their living is very basic, with their main source of income from planting rice either out of their own land (usually about 2 to 5 hectares), or someone else’s land.</p><p>They sell their harvest at about P 1,200 ($28 US) per 50 pound sack. This particular village does not sell meat so farm animals are not raised here.</p><picture>

<p>At Lloren, locals also grow various vegetables such as eggplants, beans, peas, sweet potatoes, and ocra. Vegetables are usually for their own consumption but if they have extra, they bring it to the public market to sell and get extra cash to buy their meat, fish, and other household needs. Out of the three planting seasons, the first two are during the rainy season (May to August) which are mainly used to plant rice, and the third is used to plant tobacco or peanuts. While tobacco and peanuts are cheaper commodities, Tito firmly believes that if they vary their crops from season to season, they can maintain and prolong the fertility of the soil without using fertilizers. This is in stark contrast to the farms in the west where fertilizers are commonly used to enhance the productivity of the land. I didn't realize how complex farming is and how much appreciation farmers deserve for their work. </p><picture>

<p>The four of us walk to where soil is being prepared for further planting. To prepare the ground, Tito uses water buffaloes to flow the soil. Small portable tractors can also be used, however, unless farmers are well-off, rototellers are not a commodity here at Lloren. For the size of the land, it is not worth it to buy and use heavy equipment as we know in North America.</p><p>“Would you like to ride the carabow?” Tito asks me, gesturing towards the water buffalo. </p><p></p><p>I didnt hesitate. Tito puts a banig (rug) on the buffalo’s back as he helps me climb on. It is actually similar to getting on a horse, but without the saddle gear. The backs of water buffaloes require a bit of balancing as it is not as flat as a horse’s back. My father explains when he was younger, these water buffaloes helped him cross the streams and rivers he wasn't able to do on his own. These animals deserve as much praise as Tito and other farmers: they work hand in hand growing foods we eat on daily basis. If it wasn't for water buffaloes, farmers would have difficulty preparing soils.</p><picture>

<p>For shelter, small huts--barely standing--are used as homes. My heart ached for Tito and his family: appliances such as microwaves, dishwashers, and even sinks with faucets do not exist here. Buckets of water are the main vessel used for all chores. Electronics such as televisions and computers are not available unlike some villages uphill. There are also no personal vehicles for use, rather, locals walk uphill and catch tricycle taxis or jeepneys for transportation. </p><p></p><p>The entire time we walked and chatted, I noticed distinct assigned duties within the village. Unlike the western way of living, roles between men and women remain primarily separate. One young girl is handwashing cloths by the small riverside, another woman is rinsing some vegetables in a big pot. Off in the distance, a girl and boy can be seen picking long beans from their leaves. The men, like Tito, usually do physical work such as carrying bolo (like bamboo but softer and lighter in texture) uphill for pickup, caring for the farm animals, and assisting water buffaloes harvesting the soil. Children usually play with other children but it is very common they help with adult chores, especially the girls.</p><picture>
