relatives. The aunts busily cooking outside overtop a firepit for my deceased grandfather’s prayer gathering; uncles sitting around talking, laughing, drinking; children playing amongst each other; dogs wandering around the property; pigs sleeping in their pens, roosters and chicks strut around freely on the grounds while breeding females remain in a cage to avoid contamination. It is quite overwhelming to see such a different world than what I’m accustomed to in the city. My first reaction to arriving at my father’s village where he grew up in the Philippines was, 'How long do I have to stay here?' But as the days pass, I warmed up to the way of life here. I became increasingly surprised at my elders' state of health and longevity with a few almost reaching 100 years old. How is it that my relatives here, with their standard of living, outlive my relatives in North America? </p><picture>

<p>Living conditions in Lloren Village remain primitive and primarily outdoors. As I explored the neighborhood, my immediate environment reminded me of the days when my family used to go camping. My eyes wander at the minimal house structures and design made of cement, wood, or bamboo. Generally, housing is kept very basic compared to North American housing. My relatives’ kitchen does not have appliances such as microwaves and stoves as I doubt other neighbors would. Cooking is usually done over a fire pit outside, but despite the lack of appliances, the food cooked was delicious. The bedroom in the house where my grandmother stayed is just big enough to fit a bed and dresser, with walls simply made of cement rather than drywall. I look around her room and see pictures of my grandfather and her when he was still alive. At that moment, I remember those times they babysat my brother and I back in Canada. I cant help but smile at how many generations their relationship has lasted. </p><p></p><p></p><p>I continue to look around for a washroom, also called CR, in the Philippines. This house does not have one so I walk a few steps outside to a relative's house (literally a few steps). The washrooms have no flushing toilets or shower heads, but rather buckets of cold water for use. Water pumps outside or faucets in the CR are the source for water supply.  At first, it took getting used to taking a shower just with buckets. If I wanted warm water I would have to boil water and mix it with the cold water. However, on those lazy days I rough out the cold buckets of water. It's not so bad on extremely hot days. One of my observations in Lloren village are that people not only remain in contact with nature, they are in continual contact with neighbors and family. I started to understand that quality of life does not necessarily mean having everything that money can buy. Instead of complaining what I’m lacking here, I wanted to enjoy immersing myself in their culture. What better way to help keep the body and spirit healthy than living within the natural environment.</p><picture>

<p>Perhaps it's the limited use of electronics that keep everyone outside. Although televisions are becoming more common in the households here, cable is not readily available. I also notice house phones are not as prevalent as the use of cellphones--all the adults seem to have cellphones. Computers and portable computer games are considered a luxury and are usually brought in by relatives abroad. This limited availability of electronics prevent my relatives and their neighbors from being exposed to forms of media and children have no choice but to better utilize their time on other social and education activities. For this reason, locals do not get exposed to harmful radioactive frequencies as city dwellers do.</p><p></p><p>Harmful chemicals such as food preservatives and pesticides are avoided here since they raise their own animals for eating. Of course, they are sold as well. My uncle takes good care of the big pigs as well as piglets. To sell a full grown pig would normally cost 20,000 Php (approx. $413 US) and piglets would sell for 2000 Php (approx. $42 US). Organic poultry is also frequently eaten in Lloren village but when I asked if they sell them, one of my relatives said they keep them for consumption. Given how they taste, I would keep them for myself too! By relying on growing your vegetation or raising animals for consumption, not only are unhealthy food choices uncommon, eating organic food keeps your overall health and energy levels high. </p><p></p><p>One night I was sitting outside with the adults and looking around in the darkness. I asked if safety is an issue here with no security around and limited lights. One of my uncles laugh and says everybody knows everybody here, if there ever was a burglar it would be a family member. Their dogs would also have a big dinner should there ever be an intruder. Despite dogs not being domesticated as compared to those in North America, I find the dogs around my families’ property are quite territorial. In terms of safety in Lloren village, crimes such as kidnapping, violence, and drug use do not happen in this small community. Crime rates are nowhere near what urban environments portray. No wonder I’m the only one with my eyebrows raised when the door is kept unlocked. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Another important factor to longevity is through the support of extended family. Unless some of my relatives have gone abroad, the segregation of families is almost unheard of in villages. My relatives here all live in close vicinity and maintain close-knit relationships. In fact, three houses of my relatives are within 10 steps of each other. Other relatives houses are within a 10 minute walk. Quarrels and animosity amongst friends, neighbors, and families seem to be non-existent because their elders settle any differences promptly before it sparks. Children especially keep close ties with siblings and cousins, and have great respect for their elders.</p><picture>

<p>Teamwork is obvious in this environment. I see everyone helping with cooking, cleaning, and helping the kids with homework. In fact, they are quite eager for me to teach them English during the evenings. When the majority of chores are completed, elders sit talking with each other, sharing stories and laughing. It is a heart-warming experience to witness. This close-knit family system can help avoid feelings of being overwhelmed. They don't seem to have the common stresses that cause many health problems in urban cities. It is actually common for elders to reach an age of almost 100 in Lloren Village. My grandmother is 94 and still insists on walking around. As it came time for my parents and I to leave the village and head back to the capital city of Manila, I felt deep appreciation for this visit. Not only was I able to meet relatives for the first time but I also acknowledge the way of life that the city forgets. Although the conveniences are missed here in a primitive environment, familial roots and, most importantly, well-being are enhanced.</p><picture>

<p>The modern world may not be an option for those living a primitive lifestyle such as my relatives in a third world country, but the simplicity of that lifestyle carries a secret to longevity and health. Many cultures and societies abroad like Lloren Village in the Philippines are not developed like the west. They are still accustomed to certain ways of living that many developed countries have long left behind. It is easy to forget the natural elements of this environment that are advantageous. Healthy nutrition, close family relationships, limited use of technology, maximum time outdoors all contribute to lower levels of stress, thereby increasing longevity. It is not to say it does not exist in the developed, modern day lifestyle, however, it takes on a more secondary role behind hectic work schedules. The priority for family and social gatherings decrease as well as time for healthy eating and exercise. There are efficient tools available in the modern world such as the internet and solar power that can save time and energy. However, our basic human needs for well-being are still overlooked as more monetary demands are placed upon us. With the world further developing at such a rapid rate, can we remember to put our health and well-being first and the rat race last? Has the modern world eluded our memory of where our ancestors come from and where some still live?</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="50"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="52"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="53"><span data-reactid="54"><!-- react-empty: 55 --><h2 data-reactid="56"><a data-reactid="57">Living A Simple Life: Sometimes Primitive Simplicity Can Outlive Contemporary And Choas</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="60"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="61"></div></section></div></div>

Cooking is usually done over a fire pit outside, but despite the lack of appliances, the food cooked was delicious. The bedroom in the house where my grandmother stayed is just big enough to fit a bed and dresser, with walls simply made of cement rather than drywall. I look around her room and see pictures of my grandfather and her when he was still alive. At that moment, I remember those times they babysat my brother and I back in Canada. I cant help but smile at how many generations their relationship has lasted. "},{"id":"cf1e3059-3e53-4ef5-91a0-dea498c98c3f","item":"8d9b46a8-d303-49a1-a540-e9a4b4186f3b","type":"text","html":"<p></p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]}},{"id":"85327735-2b71-4a9e-8846-b5188da560bc","item":"8d9b46a8-d303-49a1-a540-e9a4b4186f3b","type":"text","html":"<p></p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]}},{"id":"42cbb2bd-72a4-4244-8b97-0f5a019cfaca","item":"8d9b46a8-d303-49a1-a540-e9a4b4186f3b","type":"text","html":"<p>I continue to look around for a washroom, also called CR, in the Philippines.
