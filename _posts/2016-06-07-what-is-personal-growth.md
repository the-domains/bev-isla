  Personal growth is starting from the bottom of the mountain, only seeing the
  flaws that lie within your immediate surroundings. Seeing the flaws in
  everyone and every circumstance. But you reach a point where you look towards
  to the top of that mountain and want to get there. You don’t want to live
  seeing the glass half empty. You want to reach that pedestal where you can see
  everything from a different standpoint. So day by day, you start the difficult
  hike, passing by with many falls, many rest stops and plenty trees that have
  broken down in time. Those many times where you couldn’t pick yourself up and
  just wanted to give up and fall like the lifeless tree branches. And you get
  discouraged. Day by day, you wonder how long will it take? When will you get
  there? But without realizing it, you have come a long way by making that
  decision to climb as you look around you and instead of seeing the minute
  flaws in everything down below, you start seeing the whole picture. The flaws
  become tinier and tinier into space as the top is getting nearer and you
  become more elevated. You have a long way to go still but as your horizon
  broadens, climbing becomes a way of life. Perhaps the top will never come,
  perhaps it will take longer than expected and perhaps it will come tomorrow.
  But you know you’re safe because the climb only tunes in your spirituality as
  your views on the world become more whole. Instead of seeing the broken
  branches, burned down tree trunks that you saw at the bottom, now you see
  hills, green, sky,water and everything else that puts this earth in one piece.
  And that is exactly where you are heading…….to bring your soul and personality
  in one piece………………by climbing, sweating, aching……………..that is personal growth.

Personal growth is starting from the bottom of the mountain, only seeing the flaws that lie within your immediate surroundings. Seeing the flaws in everyone and every circumstance. But you reach a point where you look towards to the top of that mountain and want to get there. You don't want to live seeing the glass half empty. You want to reach that pedestal where you can see everything from a different standpoint. So day by day, you start the difficult hike, passing by with many falls, many rest stops and plenty trees that have broken down in time. Those many times where you couldn't pick yourself up and just wanted to give up and fall like the lifeless tree branches. And you get discouraged. Day by day, you wonder how long will it take? When will you get there? But without realizing it, you have come a long way by making that decision to climb as you look around you and instead of seeing the minute flaws in everything down below, you start seeing the whole picture. The flaws become tinier and tinier into space as the top is getting nearer and you become more elevated. You have a long way to go still but as your horizon broadens, climbing becomes a way of life. Perhaps the top will never come, perhaps it will take longer than expected and perhaps it will come tomorrow.
