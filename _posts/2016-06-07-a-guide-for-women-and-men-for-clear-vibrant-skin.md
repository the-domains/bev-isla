**Aging Is A Natural Process But What Can You Do About Your Skin?**

Anti-aging is such a popular term amongst North American people and has created a multi-billion dollar industry. We cannot avoid the process of aging. We all naturally go through DNA damage, cellular & tissue wear and tear, or for some, chronic diseases that shorten life spans. 

For many, anti-aging is primarily an external result than internal. One of the obvious clues of aging lies in the health of our skin. Our skin is in dynamic equilibrium with our body organs.

Beauty has become one of the pillars in defining 'success' or being accepted but do you have to go under the knife or a needle to have beautiful skin?

Most people associate facial appearance with body image. Many pursue the youthful APPEARANCE because it's associated with beauty which is in turn associated with good health, success and good life. But it's only an accessory on how your internal self is operating.

I see many people run to the most expensive boutique store to grab the overnight firming ointments. Unfortunately, in that whirlwind of trying to find the right product for you,

**8 key factors are overlooked. **

According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, facial rejuvenation procedures, both surgical and minimally-invasive, experienced the most growth in 2012\. Facelifts and eyelid surgeries were up, while 2012 marked the highest number of botulinum toxin type A (Botox(r), Dysport(r)) injections performed to date. Other facial rejuvenation procedures like soft tissue fillers, laser skin resurfacing (509,000 procedures, up 9 percent) and microdermabrasion also saw sizable increases.

_Cosmetic minimally-invasive procedures increased by 6 percent, with more than 13 million procedures in 2012\. The top five minimally-invasive procedures were:_

1. _Botulinum toxin type A (6.1 million procedures, up 8 percent) _
2. _Soft tissue fillers (2 million procedures, up 5 percent) _
3. _Chemical peel (1.1 million procedures, up 2 percent) _
4. _Laser hair removal (1.1 million procedures, up 4 percent)_

_5\. Microdermabrasion (974,000 procedures, up 8 percent)_

**What Is Skin?**

The Skin is a living organ that is moving, changing, and renewing itself (every 28 days). It protects us from external harmful influences, warns us of internal threats, plays a role in our immune system and beautifies our appearance when cared for. Essentially, our skin shows us where our overall health level is! It's the cover of the book of how we take care of ourselves. 

The rate at which your skin loses its elasticity and firmness depends on several factors including genetics and lifestyle. Skin is mainly composed of water, collagen and essential fatty acids where a deficiency in any of these will cause aging of skin and prolong the renewal cycle. 

**Anatomy of skin**

Since this book will primarily be about skin, it would be beneficial to briefly go over its basic anatomy. 

Our skin has 3 layers: 

1. deeper part of the skin called the dermis (where new skin cells form, also 90% of the skin's depth)  

This part consists of collagen, proteins, and elastins. By the time we reach approx. 25 years old, primary production of these elements come to a halt and our skin begins to lose its fullness. 

Collagen is the principal protein of our bones, cartilage, tendons and skin that provides rigidity. Elastin is a protein that gives our skin, blood vessels and organs elasticity. Without collagen and elastin, the body loses its youthful appearance, as it is no longer able to sustain moisturized and wrinkle-free skin.

Note that Fibroblasts (cells that create collagen and elastin) produce GAGS (glycosaminoglycans) which decreases as we age causing skin to depreciate, and lose water. Hyaluronic acid is a particular GAGs.

1. surface - epidermis 

This is where the compounds that keep skin hydrated are produced. Melanin is also produced here.

3) Outermost surface - stratum corneum 

Stratum corneum is what we see when we look at our skin. It acts as a raincoat. With the right skincare protocols, it sends a signal down to the layers below to produce new cells. 

**Causes of aging skin**

The causes of aging in general and the causes of aging skin come hand in hand. They are the big three: genetics, environmental and lifestyle. They all come into play to give the face you see in the mirror. 

Some particular factors just to name a few are: 

* Shortening of our telomerase (protects our DNA) activity
* Excess sugar activity
* Systemic inflammation 
* Progressive dehydration
* Toxicity
* Acidity - inhibits production of collagen and elastin; alters cell structures; leads to inflammation
* Reduced circulation & cellular energy production
* Hormone Imbalance
* Stress

Dr. Amen who wrote the book "Use Your Brain To Change Your Age" advocates that the health of your skin is a visual indicator of the health of your brain. He emphasizes that the brain-skin connection is crucial for looking young.

**What About Skin Conditions?**

Skin conditions such as psoriasis, acne, discolouration, eczema and dermatitis can also put a damper on youthful looking skin. But they can all be treated, preferably internally. Topical cosmetics are helpful but cannot replace the effects of internal care. Keep in mind that these skin conditions are the expression of the body's way of excreting internal toxins. Many of these conditions really start in our GI tract, when the lining of the intestinal tracts become thin and porous, allowing toxins to enter the bloodstream. Our organs then become overtaxed in trying to eliminate the toxins. More details on treatment for particular skin conditions will be given later. 

The bottom line is: to get your skin in great condition, you must look at the other components of what makes your skin clear and vibrant. There are people who have beautiful skin yet use minimal products and there are those who have a whole slew of products yet don't have that glowing skin.

There are 8 key factors that need to be addressed for those who are still looking for that skin transformation and even for those who simply want to have their skin looking youthful for as long as they can. Yes, skincare ingredients is one of them but the other 7 are just as important, if not more so.

Let's get started!
