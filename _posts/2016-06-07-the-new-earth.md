I find it amusing how Catholic churches continuously speak of the Second Coming of Christ and Judgement Day. Even my parents think of it literally as some man with a beard appearing from the clouds lining up everybody to give their sentence in court. So what does all the mean then? As Eckhart Tolle explains, the Second Coming is the evolution from our current world to the New Earth. It is the evolving of mass consciousness that will inhabit the new earth. It is the transition from form/identity sense of self to the awareness that all of our temporary masks and our living in a masquerade will cease to be of importance. Judgement Day may mean that only we can decide whether to accept that transition in consciousness or to continue resisting the movement to the unfamiliar. The 'awakening' of individuals can be felt as knowing there is something more but cannot be explained with your 5 physical senses so you instinctively resist. To awaken is to discover the eternal part of you that will always be there even after our bodies have turned to dust. It is realizing the security we all seek comes from our own being, Life, not from temporary pleasures. To find others who have awakened is the beginning of the new earth.

Is it worth to resist it when all resistance brings is more dissatisfaction and challenges that the Universe will bring? Eventually we will all have to ask ourselves that if we haven't already.
