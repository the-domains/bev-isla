# [Island Hopping In The Philippines: Where Seaworld And People Come Together][0]

The magnificent view underwater exhibit marine life such as gray, green and purple coral reefs, the fast moving school of green tropical fish, and the mysterious cloudiness of water further down. The various life forms below in the seaworld seem to speak to me in their own mystical language. Even the plants dancing from the ocean floor sway with a consciousness. The silence of hearing my own heartbeat and breathing as I witness this different world makes the rough boat ride out to sea that much more worth it. Located at Honda Bay, Brgy. Sta Lourdes, Puerto Princesa, island hopping in Palawan, Philippines is ideal for those that love snorkeling, diving, and sunbathing. Of the 7107 islands in the Philippines, Honda Bay is known to be one of the best dive spots in the country.

At the Hondo Bay Tourist Information and Assistance Center, visitors pay a fee for each island. I find locals are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. Comprising of six little islands or islets mostly untouched by human development, tourists can choose which to explore. The farther and longer it takes for the boat to get there, the higher the fee which includes the pump boat and boatmen for the entire day. Snorkeling equipment can also be rented with flippers and goggles costing 100 PHP ($2.05 US) each. There are no formal lessons on snorkeling, however it is quite easy to learn how to use the breathing apparatus on your own. 

Wooden pump boats resembling canoes are equipped with lifejackets, a couple benches, and a sitting area. An average of 8 people can fit on one boat. Two local handlers usually accompany each boat as one steers from the back and the other assists in anchoring and parking. Since the entire trip lasts at least a few hours, you can bring lunch and snacks onboard.

Once out on sea, it takes around 20 minutes before the handlers park the boat by a floating little hut shelter. Pambato Coral Reef is not an island but an area where coral reefs and fish are easily seen. Another floating shelter is about 20 meters away from the boat where visitors can put on gear. For those not comfortable swimming to the shelter from the boat, visitors can sit on a floating styrofoam turtle board and get pulled by a local helper. Once the gear is properly on, visitors can swim approximately 20 meters to reach the coral reef area. 

Once reaching this area, some parts are not deep; in fact, if you wanted to stand on the reefs, your head would be above the water. Below the water surface I see different shapes of coral reefs; some look like purple brains, some spiky while others look like mushroom tops. It is not recommended to touch with your hands as it may be sharp. As the life jacket keeps you afloat, you can relish on the majestic view below and the faint sounds of the underworld. It is difficult to find fishes in this area as they hide under the reefs as soon as there are any sudden movements or noises. 

Our second stop is Starfish island....a secluded island known for vast amounts of starfishes. The sandbar circles a small lagoon in the center. A few live starfishes lie in the clear shallow water where it can easily be picked up. Dont worry, they do not bite nor move. Not too many people were on this island at the time. However, several visitors were snorkeling in an area where mostly dead coral reefs can be seen. Fish are more tame here and come right up to the camera, possibly thinking they will be fed. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/79abe743-a5fa-4744-a30c-2f67af311947.jpg)

Next top, Snake Island is a 2 km long winding beach that wraps around in an S shape. There are little shops, an eating area with hut picnic tables and a beach volleyball court for visitors. The heat, especially around lunch time, is scorching and makes it hard to be exposed in the sun for too long without shade. Despite that, more people occupy this island as compared to others. Various activities such as swimming, snorkeling, eating, vendor shopping makes this island more lively. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ef230d71-b78d-4366-bac5-789a11df5724.jpg)

Luli Island, derived from the Tagalog word 'lulubog' means 'sinking' is known to be submersed underwater during high tide periods. As our boat passes the island, wooden cottages can be seen sitting on stilts for that reason. White, yellow and blue flags stick out from the sand as reference points during high tide. At this time, only few people were on the island. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6c60bd6c-9713-4909-9bc3-db694d965726.jpg)

On our way back to Hondo Bay from Snake Island, waves lightly splashes into the boat with winds starting to pick up and clouds rolling in. One of the best aspects of being out in the sea are the impressive landscapes of picturesque hills, shores and islets. Being an expert at snorkeling or diving is not necessary to fully experience island hopping. The boat ride and visits to virgin beach little islands makes for a memorable heartfelt experience for families as well as lone travelers.
