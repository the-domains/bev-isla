# [Tapuakan River: Finding Serenity][0]

Some travelers will fly to tourist-dense destinations for relaxation but what about finding solitude in remote nature? 

Our jeep rumbled over the bumpy road amidst the tropical trees and plants. "Where are we heading?" I wearily asked my father, my lack of sleep catching up with me. He answers, "To Tapuakan river where your aunt, uncle, and I used to go to when we were kids." Since I arrived here in the Philippines, everyday has been on the go with no time for rest or sleeping in, but this place was our last stop before heading back to the village of Lloren. Tucked behind the lush green hills of LaUnion, we finally came to a stop in front of a rundown hut with a wooden sign that read, 'Tapuakan River, 5 PHP Entrance Fee'.  Stone steps leading downwards are off to one side, on the other were beautiful green rice fields that gleamed from the sun's rays. Now I was getting my energy back. An exploration that seemed to be interesting. Since no one was in the hut, we just headed down. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b78accc4-204b-4c41-ba8b-51d83d766374.jpg)

My father, aunt, and uncle behind me, I started the descent towards what looked like a ravine. The winding stone steps are not evenly leveled as grass and weeds grew alongside it and in the cracks. After a few minutes of hopping from stone to stone, I saw the river--or at least what was left of it. The short hike down is worthwhile and rejuvenating as each step reveals more of the river that was once rapid and deep. Who would have known this hidden place even existed amongst the deep forests? When we reached the bottom, my aunt and uncle started taking pictures of boulders twice my height. My father pulls out his cigarette and looks around. I slowly put one leg in the fresh, cool water that graciously came from the mountains. Seeming safe, I waded knee-deep into water. With the sun blazing directly overhead, the water felt perfect.

I wanted to take in all my physical senses at this moment. The sounds of lapping water around me and the trees bustling from the breeze provide a calming, tranquil effect. Natural erosion has left stone flooring that line the bottom of the stream smooth and curvy--not to mention slightly slippery. Lumps of rock formations protrude throughout the stream that can also be used for sitting or tanning. In between are pockets of water that can serve as knee-deep dipping pools. Evaporation also has left the water calmer and softer as it eases away any anxiety in therapeutic waves. Should this river completely disappear, it would have a rippling effect on many life forms that rely on it. It saddens me to think that is the likely outcome of one of Earth's beautiful spots.

On our way back up, I see a cascade area elevated on a rock slope where water has completely dried up. What was once a waterfall now only leaves a black trail of erosion on the rock escarpment. How pretty that would have been if it had not evaporated. Bamboo tables with tropical hut overheads are propped alongside the stream on rocks. To get a more aerial view of the river, they are also atop boulder formations. These eatery setups can serve for picnic purposes and even napping that anyone can enjoy. This truly is a place where visitors can embellish tranquility.

If it wasn't for the sun's descent, I would have stayed longer in the still consciousness that nature provides. The spiritual force of Tapuakan river is an ideal environment for a solitary retreat where serenity and solitude can engulf your entire being. This sanctuary where earth elements come together instantly comforts and subdues any feelings of unease. It is also where I can truly appreciate Earth's existence and hope that humanity is not too late in saving our planet's treasures. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f9e72c0c-f035-4b59-8477-d8a8c67722a2.jpg)
