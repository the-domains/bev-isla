_Foster Dog Beau (above) was going to be put down but we found him a home the same week! _

For many, the love of their pets, is comparable to that of family members. For most pets, the love for their owners is the true love that we dream of. No barriers, no conditions, just pure love. See, I view the H-C bond as more than just the linear perception of friendship or companionship. The 2 way street of the human canine bond has dynamics that are far beyond the external day to day interactions. It is more than just feeding them, or playing with them, in return we get kisses and cuddles. What do I mean by this? 

The fact is, we live in a multitude of energies and everything in our life is run by it. Every interaction we make, within ourselves and with others, influences the ebb and flow of our energetic frequencies. Where in the spectrum our energy is on the grid depends on where we are in our own personal development journey. More and more people are opening up to this awareness. Dogs in particular are very keen in picking this up in us and around us. Whether you believe it or not, our canine friends absorb and take on our energy, it is their nature. They obviously won't tell you this but they do, everyday they are with you. 

It is important to keep your energy levels clean and avoid holding too much heavy baggage, resentment, anger, and all the other emotions that are of low frequency. Your dog will not only feel it, they will, in their own way, take it on to alleviate the burden it has on you until it builds up in them. Until you take responsibility for your own frequencies, the ones holding you down can't just go away on its own, with or without a dog. As most personal development coaches teach, we do need to be our best version to be able to give to others. This includes giving to your pet. 

I have a soft spot for rescues and the pain they experience, physically and emotionally. Somewhere along the chain, they have been let down either by people, hostile environments like natural disasters or just draw of a bad circumstance. I encourage those 17 million people who are looking for a dog to save and adopt them. As Sharon from Maddie's Fund says, we need just over 2 million of those 17 million to adopt for involuntary euthanasia to disappear. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bd5275b8-d07e-4ad1-b04b-c6103d84a756.jpg)
