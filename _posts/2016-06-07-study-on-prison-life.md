The prison, as an institution, invokes sanctions as the primary purpose, leading to various effects. Specifically, the harsh and punitive conditions experienced by prisoners attribute to the negative effects within the prison environment. Whether negative behavior is the prisoners' way of coping with reality, immorality and depravity are common feelings found within the prison environment. It is also important to mention that the negative effects of imprisonment is not quick to be publicized due to the masked nature of it, therefore, studies lack in this aspect of the prison life. For instance, the issue of brutality in the prison environment of Sing Sing prison in New York State and P4W in Ontario has been examples that contribute to the negative effects. Nevertheless, prisons are institutions where individuals who are correlated with it on a daily basis undergo a change in attitude once integrated in the system.

It is important to address how severe incarceration only strains the relationships between guards, prisoners and members of superior positions. In regards to the complex pattern of social relationships between guards and inmates, hostility is likely to erupt between them due to the abuse of power from officers or violence by inmates. Thus, a cycle is created when inmates and officers take out their negative attitude toward each other only contributing to more negative behavior.

A major factor that contributes to the negative effects of imprisonment on inmates involves their living conditions while in prison. For example, in Sing Sing prison, inmates were not even allowed to have any sort of electronics to keep them company, to write letters to contact other friends, nor any leisure time with their friends that are also in the institution. Such examples of living conditions give reason why it is common for inmates at Sing Sing prison to be late in getting back in their cells to communicate with other inmates, or to argue with each other on who gets the shower privileges first.

Secondly, security is a common notion in prison lifestyle. Specifically, being victims of violence from other inmates are incidents common in the environment. Another example at Sing Sing was the ongoing gang fights between the Cripps and the Bloods. This tension between the two gangs has resulted in many being wounded and likely to increase fear amongst other inmates who may be associated with either group. The last aspect to note about prisoner- prisoner violence is that most reported incidents obscure the actual incidents in prison since it is something most inmates will not disclose.Third, also common to prison life is the abuse of inmates from correctional officers or managers. This can have a lasting negative effect on the inmate's physical and mental health. This also is hidden from publicity since many authorities will not likely disclose each confrontation they have had with inmates. Unfortunately, this excessive force was not rare in Sing Sing prison during the 19th century. Many inmates were recorded to have been whipped enough times to be severely wounded and unconscious. It is not undeniable that brutal force, in some circumstances is needed for the compliance of inmates but in every situation it is questionable if inmates really deserve such treatment. Hence, abusive powers from prison authorities amounts to the prisoner-staff violence that only increases hostility between inmates and prison authorities.

Fourth, the fact that inmates are deprived of quality time with their families, spouses or close friends can have an impact on their personal well-being. At Sing Sing prison, for instance, the visiting room was a place where the inmates received time with their loved ones. Thus, in addition to experiencing the conditions of prison, inmates are also left to ponder of what will happen to their relationships outside of prison. They are left unable to support and contribute to their relationships with their children or their wives. This experience, being a fact of prison life also adds to their pessimistic overlook of the system.

Lastly, the reality of social degradation can take a toll on inmates in which the individual's identity is destroyed. Consequently, after being degraded, deviance is preferred when inmates reject conventional prison norms. This brings the creation of the prison subculture in order to restore inmate's status. What erupts from social degradation, then, is the rejection of prison rules and the formation of negative attitudes toward the correctional system.As can be seen, the prison environment produces harsh conditions for many inmates, which creates incentives for corrupt behavior since it may decrease the 'pains of imprisonment'. However, conditions may also vary depending on the time period. Consequently, is it important for policy makers to understand the prison environment to implement policy implications.

The crucial element in policy implications is to decrease hostility between inmates and officer relationships as well as to improve the living conditions in the correctional environment. Changing such living conditions could alleviate negative behavioral cues on behalf of the inmates. In addition, changing the sentencing policies could promote more effective social order. For instance, parole boards could be enhanced in order to decrease length of sentencing thus avoiding the 'prisonization' process as well as the 'pains of imprisonment.' Similarly, indeterminate sentencing could be implemented to increase incentives for good behavior on behalf of the inmates. Alternatives to prison could also be seen as a way to avoid such negative effects of imprisonment. Such alternatives could include: community treatments or halfway housing. Thus, policy implications should focus on decreasing the 'pains of imprisonment', 'prisonization', the 'importation' of the deviant subculture and the stripping of the 'self.'

For instance, the control of the organization should be reformed in order to decrease the abusive authority of correctional officers. Guidelines used to review inmates' process should be enhanced in order to establish any releases or transfers. Such examples of policy implications address the need to alleviate the pains of imprisonment for inmates and to reform the internal operations within prisons in order to change officers' punitive attitude toward treating inmates harshly. This, in turn would strike a balance between punishing deserving inmates and using reasonable sanctions to pursue criminal justice.
