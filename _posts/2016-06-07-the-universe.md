The concept of space and the Universe is so magnificent how can you ignore looking up on a clear night? Because......

Take away all the objects, planets, stars in space what would you see? Nothing. Just consciousness. It wouldnt be known or acknowledged as anything because it doesnt stand out. Now put back the objects, now it is something; the space that allows every planet, star, sun to exist and be. It is the eternity (the unmanifested) that will still exist even if everything else within it (the manifested) ceases to be. The Universe' depth is unimaginable, its size unexplainable, but yet the objects are given much more importance. THAT IS WHAT WE DO TO OURSELVES.

The unmanifested part of ourselves, our INNER BEING, OUR DIVINITY, allows us to be, allows all of our temporary identities to exist but yet we dont treasure the eternal part of ourselves, we give more importance to what will eventually turn to dust. Our Inner energy and Source is obscured just as 'space' is. We're too concerned with our physical bodies and everything that affects it. But our inner depth runs limitless, it will be there when everything else crumbles, just like the Universe will still exist even if all the galaxies were to disappear. If everyone were to acknowledge and tap into the eternal Inner Being of themselves, there would be nothing to fear, not even the term we label death. 

That is why what allows the objects in space to be is not appreciated; the same reason why we don't FEEL our Inner Being, we've attached a permanent identity to what is only an illusion. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4e2efe1c-b102-4b9a-9b7d-e2197f69ee30.png)
