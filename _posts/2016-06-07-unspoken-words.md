Wouldn't it be wonderful if everyone was able to reach a level of understanding and acceptance where it goes beyond communication but rather through unspoken words? Wouldn't it be great to just look at your significant other, your mother, your child, your brother, your friend and understand each other's being?

Every single person has their differences, any perfect couple will go through their differences, every single child will one day think their parents are from Mars. Wouldnt it be great if you can go through differences and breath a sigh of relief for coming to terms with it?

Anyone can reach that level to exhale. Anyone can walk over the rapid waters by simply finding a bridge. Anyone can just watch the rapids from the sideline. Unfortunately, many would rather jump in and let the currents sweep them away. It is much easier to lash out at someone than accept that people have different priorities, that everyone has their own paths to go through, that even the closest people to you have their own desires to live by.

So how can you understand in the midst of emotionl chaos? I cannot answer that but is it much more worth it to swim upstream rather than to step aside, let the currents pass through, and see what really is at hand clearer. It is only through that clarity where you will know which path is yours to take. So keep that courage and walk your path. You will begin to trust and when you look all around you, you understand............through unspoken words.
