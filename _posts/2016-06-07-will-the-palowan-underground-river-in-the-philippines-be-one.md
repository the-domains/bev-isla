The sunlight dimmed behind the narrow canoe as the darkness upfront draws nearer. The smell of wet seaweed washed ashore from the ocean and the sounds of water dripping from amongst the cave ceiling surrounds us. The ambience fills with curiosity as our group submerge in the unknown environment of what dwells in the rocky tunnels within. The longest navigable underground river in the world runs 8.2 km, is part of the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in the Philippines. It has also been nominated to be one of the World's Seven Wonders. This river flows underneath a magnificent limestone mountain landscape that exits directly into the South China Sea. However, this cave system can only allow boat tours to go up to 4 km in before turning back due to low rock ceilings. According to the guide, it was in 1971 that Americans first explored this cave.

As our paddle banca with outriggers crawl further in, the only light available is from one large flashlight that the person sitting in front holds. Tour boats resemble that of narrow canoes but the side edges are close to the water's surface level. Our guide navigates from the back of the boat as other tour boats glide past going the opposite direction. The light from digital cameras are limited making photos difficult to capture. However, limited light sources prevent large mosquitos from hovering nearby. The brownish green waters' depth lies between 10 feet to 29 feet deep depending on low or high tide periods. In fact, the lower portions of the river is subject to tidal influences. During high tide periods, parts of the cave is actually underwater. The highest point in the entire cave is a 65 ft tall domed amphitheater above ground level which is never underwater. It is not recommended to go swimming in the area as it is too dark and potentially hazardous. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9dec9199-6627-4d31-a4c7-0f8fb9989d12.jpg)

Above us parts of the rock ceilings boast hundreds of bats, too dark and too far up to see in detail. A few fly near the top but does not cause any harm to visitors. The bats also do not react to the sound of voices. Their glowing eyes can be seen if you watch carefully. It can be a mesmerizing yet anxious and eerie moment to see creatures not common in the city-life. As far as the guides are concerned, there are no crocodiles or sharks dwelling in the cave area. If there are other life forms living here, it probably would not be visible to  visitors.  

Our guide proceeds to accurately describe the major formations the boat passes. "Just ahead to the right is a whitish smooth rock that resembles a woman." The flashlight holder must be quick at following the guides' instructions of where to point in order for the shapes to be seen. Sharp rock pillars also hang from overhead. Aligning the cave walls are unique rock formations and boulders such as stalactites, stalagmites and large chambers. The cave wall where rock meets water also exhibit marble-like material while others display a smooth lumpy texture. 

Smaller tunnel pathways and black hallow recesses ahead lead deeper into the cave where visitors would have to duck should they choose to continue. It is at this point where our tour guide slows the canoe to turn around due to low ceilings, sharp twists and turns. To further proceed to the inner depths of the niches and tunnels before flowing out into the sea may require more skilled scuba divers. Although curiosity of the mystical environment beyond our turning point irk many visitors, the point of sunlight upon return bring about some relief. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/00764f4b-fd61-4a88-b183-31fbfb1bd8e7.jpg)

Visitors can be assured lifejackets and hard hats are provided. Professional tour guides are very knowledgeable of the cave area and know exactly what and where everything is without the need for flashlights.
