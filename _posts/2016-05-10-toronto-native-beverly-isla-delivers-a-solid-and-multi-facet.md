Toronto native Beverly Isla delivers a solid and multi-faceted background in communications to the social causes that have inspired her support. After honing her skills in public relations, public speaking, holistic health, television/video production, project management and writing, Isla decided that it was time to heed a holistic call and focus on topics that are close to her heart: wellbeing, health, personal development, animal welfare, and sustainable and green living.

Her involvement with various industries has opened up a new avenue for her skills. She has implemented email marketing campaigns; produced & edited interview-based web series with various experts; analyzed strategies to implement new campaigns; acted as a spokesperson at trade shows and career fairs; collaborated cross-promotional activities; and provided education to the public and stakeholders.

If it sounds as though Beverly Isla is strongly motivated, both in her professional and personal roles, to advance the holistic aspects of life, you're right. But the strength of her convictions mean that she dedicates herself to the causes that she promotes. Isla's belief in the freedom of the press means that the public is entitled to the freedom to be informed about the concerns facing the planet, along with the freedom to know all the options available rather than the options that are officially promoted because they favor bureaucratic red tape.

Advocacy requires a deft hand at telling the truth. Isla is firmly committed to the conviction that if people were aware of the truth, rather than illusions, lives would be very different. She acknowledges that being an advocate for social justice can be, as she puts it, "tricky" because disclosure can offend people, even when the truth is something people need to know for their own wellbeing.

Communication has entered a new era of public access, one that's particularly well suited to Isla's background. Her writing has appeared in print and online publications such as_The Family Magazine_,_Can Fit Pro_, and_The Examiner.com_, along with Demand Studios. She's written for television news and also has been featured in a best-selling book, _Making it in High Heels_, to polish off her media resume. 

Her goal, whether she's serving the public interest as an individual advocate or issuing press releases on behalf of an organization, is to make use of her cutting-edge technological skills in a cause where values, passion, and integrity are priorities. As part of a team, she carries her workload with enthusiasm and energy, and can be counted on to do her part, keeping the connection strong through social media and newsletters. Her current project is Save A Pooch, that supports dogs in need find homes and help educate individuals on the issues of canine welfare. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5a89541f-576f-490a-af0b-1ace9ec2cbfd.jpg)

Isla's special cause, the one that's closest to her heart because she has a soft spot for dogs in need, and has fostered dogs for rescue organizations, is animals. By using various media outlets, producing educational videos on YouTube, and drafting press releases for distribution to international media, she has raised awareness of canine welfare.

You can view her show on [**Pet Life Radio**][0], where she interviews animal welfare professionals. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5306429e-2803-46eb-82b8-a486fb936d2f.png)
